    "One way to test if a number (let's call it $n$) is a prime number is to try dividing it by every number less than it. But if we think about this a little longer, we will see that we only need to check if it's divisible prime numbers less than it. That's because if a number is divisible by $a \\times b$, it must also be divisible by $a$ and by $b$. If we think even longer, we will see that we don't need to try numbers greater than $\\frac{1}{2}n$, since they definitely can't evenly divide $n$, because the quotient would be less than $2$, but not $1$. If there is a square-root of $n$ (a number that we can square to get $n$), so that $x^2=n$, we only need to check prime numbers less than $x$, because anything bigger would have a smaller quotient, which we would have already checked.\n",

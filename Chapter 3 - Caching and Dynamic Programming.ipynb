    "# Caching and Dynamic Programming\n",
    "Caching (Cache-ing, or making a cache, pronounced \"cash-ing\") is a very important technique in many areas of computing, and it just means \"storing information for future use\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memo: Caching**  \n",
    "Caching is storing information for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already know how to store information, using variables, so what makes caching different? Caching is about storing information that we might want to use multiple times, so we don't have to find it again. Many of the functions that we've looked at produce the same value every time you give them the same input. For example, executing the fibonacci function on 2 and 3 always produces 5. (Put another way, the 5th Fibonacci number is always 5.) If I ever need to use the 5th Fibonacci number (such as when computing the 6th Fibonacci number), instead of computing it, I could just check the variable where I stored the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is going to mostly explore different ways of computing Fibonacci numbers, using functions, loops, and caching. At the end will be a set of problems requiring you to apply these techniques to other functions and sequences, so that you can answer your own questions about them. But first, let's learn about time:"

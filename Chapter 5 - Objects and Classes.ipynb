    "You've already been exposed to objects and methods. For example, every time we've used `some_list.append()`, this was calling the method (function) `append` associated with the `some_list` object. We can define our own classes using Python.\n",

    "**Syntax: Classes**  \n",
    "Classes are defined using the `class` keyword. Methods can be defined inside the class description. There are several special methods, called _magic methods_ or _dunder methods_ (after the double underscores __ in their name) that Python uses to do special things.  One of them is the `__init__` method, which is used to create an object from the class description. (You can read about the others [here](https://micropyramid.com/blog/python-special-class-methods-or-magic-methods/).)  \n",
    "Methods of an object always take an extra first parameter which refers to the object itself (it is frequently called `self`, but we could call it anything). Data specific to the object, as well as its methods, can be referenced by using the `.` syntax on the object `self` refers to.  \n",
    "Objects can be created from the definition provided by a class by using the class name. This is called object \"construction\"."

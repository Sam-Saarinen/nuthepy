    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This course will serve as both a standards-aligned (you'll take a standardized exam at the end) introduction to Computer Science (you'll learn to program in Python) and a broad introduction to Number Theory (you'll get to explore some really interesting math).\n",

    "**CSTA Standards Alignment:**  \n",
    "This course addresses CSTA computing standards 2-AP-10, 2-AP-11, 2-AP-12, 2-AP-13, 2-AP-14, 2-AP-16, 2-AP-17, and 2-AP-19, (8 of 23 standards for middle grades) *and* computing standards 3A-CS-01, 3A-DA-10, 3A-DA-12, 3A-AP-13, 3A-AP-14, 3A-AP-15, 3A-AP-17, 3A-AP-18, 3A-AP-23 (9 of 30 standards for 9th and 10th grade). Students will receive a much deeper understanding of programming and the mathematics of computation than is normally covered in an introductory class, but the CSTA standards also address very broad topics like security, design, and accessibility, which are outside the focus of this class, which is on using programming to answer mathematical questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number Theory Topics:**\n",
    "0. Numbers and Sets\n",
    "1. Divisibility\n",
    "2. Primes\n",
    "3. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic\n",
    "4. Factorization and Euler's Phi Function\n",
    "5. Greatest Common Divisor and Least Common Multiple (Euclidean Algorithm)\n",
    "6. Congruences, Chinese Remainder Theorem\n",
    "7. Quadratic Residues and Reciprocity\n",

    "[//]: # (http://www.openproblemgarden.org/category/number_theory_0)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Format:**  \n",
    "The course will consist of a series of chapters. Each chapter will introduce new programming syntax (notations that are part of the Python language), math concepts, recipes (steps for solving problems), memorizable content, and problems / open questions. The final grade in the course will be based on two factors: completion of the final problem set; and retention of the memorized content.  \n",
    "[//]: # (Syntax, Math, Recipe, Memo, Problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapters:**\n",
    "0. Numbers, Names, and Python - Compute Divisibility\n",
    "1. Datastructures and Control Flow - Representing Factorization and Binary Numbers\n",
    "2. Functions and Functional Programming - Boolean Logic and Sequences\n",
    "3. Caching and Dynamic Programming - Faster Fibonacci's, Exponents, and Sequences\n",
    "4. Algorithms - Fast Primes, Factorization, and Fibonacci's\n",
    "5. Objects and Classes - Rationals, Permutations, and Groups\n",
    "6. The Future - Advanced Topics in Math and Programming  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each chapter is planned to take about 2 class meetings (4 hours, across two weeks). In addition to the 24 total hours of face-to-face instructional time, students will be expected to put in about half an hour of work per day (across six days each week) for a total of 3 hours of homework per week, or 36 hours across the duration of the course. This will bring the total course time to 60 hours.  \n",
    "[//]: # (Homework will generally be divided into 6 portions per week, making it simple for students to focus on one part per day.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Software:**  \n",
    "At minimum, students should come into the class with a development environment and Python 3 installation. The course notes and lessons will take advantage of Jupyter notebooks and the Spyder development environment. (Install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ to get Python 3, Jupyter notebooks, and Spyder installed at one time). If that installation does not work, students may use any other development environment they choose, although they will not be able to take advantage of the features of Jupyter or Spyder. A classic Python development environment is the IDLE that comes with a stand-alone Python installation. (See https://www.python.org/downloads/ to install the IDLE.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus:**  \n",
    "Many problems will come from projecteuler.net; students should feel free to browse the site and create an account. No problems are off limits, but some may require additional knowledge in order to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memo: Counting From 0**  \n",
    "This is something to remember. Why does the homework start counting at 0? In computer science, we frequently start counting items from 0, so that the number indicates the quantity of items that have come before. In other words, Homework 0 had 0 homeworks before it, Homework 1 had 1 homework assignment before it (namely, Homework 0), etc."

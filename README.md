# nuthepy (Number Theory for Python)
Learn the basics of programming with Python, while also exploring algorithmic approaches to Number Theory. (Write code and do cool math.)

# How to Get Started
These notes use Jupyter notebooks (a generalization of iPython notebooks). Although they can be viewed directly on GitHub.com, they can also be used interactively by installing the Anaconda package and using Jupyter Notebook (installed with Anaconda) to view them. First-time readers/users should start with the syllabus and course outline in the section labeled "Introduction", which includes additional installation instructions. The entire repository can be downloaded as a zip file from GitHub if you wish to work with the notebooks directly.
